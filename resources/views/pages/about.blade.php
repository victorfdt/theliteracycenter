<h3>The Literacy Center</h3>

<p>
	The Literacy Center is a not-for-profit organization in Evansville, Indiana. Our mission is to improve basic adult literacy in our community.
</p>

<p>
	We have been active in the Evansville community since 1966 and have helped thousands of men and women better their lives through literacy. Our volunteers provide a variety of services including confidential tutoring at no cost to those who seek to improve their reading and writing skills.
</p>

<p>
	Though we are a separate organization, Ivy Tech State College-Southwest generously donates administrative and training space at its campus on the north side of Evansville. Our office is in the “Plaza” at 3411-A, just two doors down from the Ivy Tech Bookstore.
</p>

<p>
	Please contact us if you need our services or know someone who needs are services, if you are interested in becoming a tutor, volunteer or donor…or if you simply have any questions.
