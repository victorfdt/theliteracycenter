<h1>The Literacy Center</h1>


The Literacy Center is a not-for-profit organization in Evansville, Indiana. Our mission is to improve basic adult literacy in our community.

We have been active in the Evansville community since 1966 and have helped thousands of men and women better their lives through literacy. Our volunteers provide a variety of services including confidential tutoring at no cost to those who seek to improve their reading and writing skills.

Though we are a separate organization, Ivy Tech State College-Southwest generously donates administrative and training space at its campus on the north side of Evansville. Our office is in the “Plaza” at 3411-A, just two doors down from the Ivy Tech Bookstore.

Please contact us if you need our services or know someone who needs are services, if you are interested in becoming a tutor, volunteer or donor…or if you simply have any questions.
